# tictactoe
A little project where I wanted to build an in-browser tic tac toe game.

View the project live at [kimkvn.github.io/tictactoe](kimkvn.github.io/tictactoe)

The guts of the game is built with jQuery/Javascript.

Sass CSS preprocessor to help with styling.

And a lil' bit of Bootstrap sprinkled in to help with prettying up buttons and default borders and positioning just a smidge.

Future steps include: 

-find a way to seriously refactor the logic checking. There's gotta be a better way. 

-Maybe try building this with React 

-Incorporate actual Xs and Os. Or maybe custom player "pieces" to take the place of Xs or Os 

-Figure out a way to make this playable between two people on different windows
